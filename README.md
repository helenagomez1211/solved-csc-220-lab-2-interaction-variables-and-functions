Exercise interaction, variables and functions in Processing.

<strong>Tasks: </strong>

Design an drawable object. This could be whatever you feel like drawing. To draw your object, you should use the following function:

void drawMyObject(float x, float y, float w, float h) {          … }

Insert the name of your object in place of “MyObject” in the function name. Write a program that interactively draws several versions of the object in a 500 x 500 sketch. Different versions of the object should appear at different positions and have different sizes. You may use the random number function to generate x, y, w and h values. You can also vary the coloring of the object each time it is drawn. Your sketch should use some interactivity (using the mouse) in some way (you can design whatever interactivity you desire).

<strong>In your overall sketch pay special attention to the aesthetic aspects of your design as well as interactivity. Be sure to use the programming features you have learned in the last week or two. Make sure that your signature is on your sketch!</strong>

Start your program with a comment that has your name, the name of the course, and the title of the assignment:
